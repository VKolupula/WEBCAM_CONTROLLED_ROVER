# WEBCAM_CONTROLLED_ROVER
 Webcam controlled rover to follow paths, move objects with a forklift, and avoid obstacles.
 
## Project Overview
The Webcam Controlled Rover project consists of a programmable robot that can communicate with MATLAB over Wi-Fi to perform operations using an image processing algorithm. The Rover is built using an Arduino Nano 33 IoT, the Arduino Nano Motor Carrier, two DC motors with encoders and a micro-servo motor. On top of the Rover, there is a color-coded sticker that will serve as a marker to assist the image processing algorithm that uses a webcam to detect the location and orientation of the robot.
